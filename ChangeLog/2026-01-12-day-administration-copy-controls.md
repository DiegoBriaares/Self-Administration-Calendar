Name: Day administration wrapper + copy controls cleanup
Description: Introduces a Day Administration container that groups Day Events and the copy workflow, refreshes labels to match copy-only range behavior, removes duplicate range event listings, adds single-target date selection, and fixes a RangeBoard hook-order crash after selection. Also moves role management into its own Roles section.
