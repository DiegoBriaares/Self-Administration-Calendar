# Business Requirements

## Business goals (increase X, reduce Y)
Increase note organization clarity by adding a subrole layer for event notes; reduce time spent selecting the correct role and reduce duplicate/overloaded top-level roles.

## Product scope
Add subrole CRUD in the Roles dashboard, add subrole selection in the day role picker flow, and store subroles per user alongside roles and event notes.

## High-level constraints (legal, budget, time)
No new infrastructure or paid services; feature must fit the existing React + Express + SQLite stack and be deliverable within the current release cycle without schema-breaking migrations.

## Success metrics (KPIs)
At least 30% of active users create subroles within two weeks, average time to reach notes after role selection decreases, and support requests about role clutter decrease.
