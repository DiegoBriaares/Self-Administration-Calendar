New component - accesible in front end through a button between the coordinates (months) selector component and the calendar component. Button displaying text Postponed events". When button is clicked, it brings you to a new page, which has the same three features of the Day Administration component, with exact same functionality as the current functionality (current functionality will change by incorporating this new component, but I'll describe afterwards), but with different names: (DAY EVENTS ADMINISTRATION -> EVENTS ADMINISTRATION, DAY EVENTS INFORMATION -> EVENTS INFORMATION, DAY EVENTS MANAGEMENT -> EVENTS MANAGEMENT) - This new component is called Postponed events component and it should have its own database table(s), independent to the tables for the events on days in the calendar. Inside the page with the Administration component (this name also changes: Day Administration -> Administration), all functionalities should be copied, including adding events directly (without moving/copying from a particular day).

The current functionality of the DAY EVENTS MANAGEMENT and DAY EVENTS INFORMATION features of the Day Administration component must change. DAY EVENTS MANAGEMENT should incorporate a button to move/copy (according to selection) the selected events to the postpone events (thus copying the data from the database tables). DAY EVENTS INFORMATION should also track if this events was postponed previously, virtually adding in the frontend appearing when clicking Track Record a " previously Postponed" mark. This mark logically according to previous statements should not be in the EVENTS INFORMATION feature in the Postponed event component, since it not the current functionality.

In the EVENTS MANAGEMENT feature of Postponed events component, moving/copying events should have the same effect as current functionality i.e actually moving/copying events to the calendar (from postponed events database tables to calendar events tables).
