# Business Requirements

## Business goals (increase X, reduce Y)
Increase weekly focus by separating "this week" postponed items from the long-term backlog; reduce time spent scanning irrelevant postponed events.

## Product scope
Add a postponed-view toggle in the postponed events administration header, filter all postponed features by the selected view, and allow day administration copy/move to choose the target view.

## High-level constraints (legal, budget, time)
No new infrastructure or paid services; must fit current React + Express + SQLite stack and ship within the current development cycle.

## Success metrics (KPIs)
Users create/assign postponed events into both views; average time to locate a relevant postponed item decreases; reduced manual edits to move events out of the backlog.
