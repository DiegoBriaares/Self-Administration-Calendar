# Plan Administration Management System (PAMS)

A full-stack calendar application with event management, roles-based notes, and an admin panel.

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- **Node.js** (v18 or higher)
- **npm** (comes with Node.js)

### Installation

```bash
# 1. Clone/copy the project
cd /path/to/plan-administration-management-system

# 2. Install frontend dependencies
npm install

# 3. Install server dependencies
cd server && npm install && cd ..
```

### Running the App

**Option A: Run both in separate terminals**

```bash
# Terminal 1 - Start the backend server
cd server && node index.js
# Server runs at http://localhost:3001

# Terminal 2 - Start the frontend
npm run dev
# Frontend runs at http://localhost:5173
```

**Option B: Quick start script (run from project root)**

```bash
# Start server in background, then frontend
cd server && node index.js & cd .. && npm run dev
```

## 🔄 Patch Production Copy (keep DB/uploads)

- Default production path is `/Users/digogonz/Desktop/Calendario/cal-ap`.
- One-shot deploy: run `bash scripts/deploy_to_prod.sh` from the dev root. It syncs code, installs deps in the prod copy (frontend + server), and leaves DB/uploads untouched.
- Dry run: `DRY_RUN=1 bash scripts/deploy_to_prod.sh` (only previews rsync).
- Skip installs: `SKIP_INSTALL=1 bash scripts/deploy_to_prod.sh` (sync only).
- Override prod path: `PROD_DIR=/custom/path bash scripts/deploy_to_prod.sh`.
- Under the hood it uses `scripts/patch_to_prod.sh`, which protects `server/calendar.db*`, `server/uploads/`, and root `uploads/`; stale code is cleaned with `--delete`.
- After a deploy, restart the production services if they are running.

## 🔧 Fresh Start (Clean Database)

To start with a completely fresh database:

```bash
# Remove database files
rm -f server/calendar.db server/calendar.db-shm server/calendar.db-wal

# Optional: Clear uploaded files
rm -rf server/uploads/*

# Restart the server (creates fresh DB)
cd server && node index.js
```

## 👤 First Admin User

When starting fresh, create an admin user:

1. Register a new user via the frontend at http://localhost:5173
2. Access the admin panel at http://localhost:3001
3. The first user can be promoted to admin by editing the database

Or use the seeded admin account (if available):
- **Username:** `admin`
- **Password:** `admin123`
