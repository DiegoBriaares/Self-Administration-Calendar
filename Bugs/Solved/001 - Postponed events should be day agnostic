I se ethat there is a day selector in the postponed events page, but this events are day agnostic, is just a raw list
  of events without day. Make modifications to database tables, front end and mechanisms accordingly, so that when
  moving/copying an event to postponend events it must appear in postponed events withput the need to select a day/
  range of days.
