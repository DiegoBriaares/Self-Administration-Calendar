- Pull review comments from GitHub (PR review comments, review threads/inline comments, and conversation comments).
- Ensure inline review feedback (e.g., Codex thread comments on specific files/lines) is included, not just top-level review summaries.
- For each comment, verify whether it is still applicable to the current codebase.
- If applicable, implement a fix; if not, document why it is obsolete.
- Add or update tests for the fixes when reasonable.
- Summarize which comments were resolved vs. skipped and why.
