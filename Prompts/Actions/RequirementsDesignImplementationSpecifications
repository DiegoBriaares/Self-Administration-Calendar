Please based on this, as excellence allows it (i.e no noise just for perfection in all points that ill later describe, but if not including a point, brtiefly write a justification, so at the end all of the points should be convered), abstract requirements (business requirements, functional requirements), design (logical design and technical design) the new feature and implement. 


The business requirements should output in new file /Users/digogonz/Desktop/Desarrollo/calendar-app/Enhancements/[x]/BusinessRequirements.md the following in concrete and write that concrete content (each concrete content below the abstract title which is simply the corresponding point of the following ones):
	•	Business goals (increase X, reduce Y)
	•	Product scope
	•	High-level constraints (legal, budget, time)
	•	Success metrics (KPIs)

The functional requirements should output in new file /Users/digogonz/Desktop/Desarrollo/calendar-app/Enhancements/[x]/FunctionalRequirements.md the following in concrete and write that concrete content (each concrete content below the abstract title which is simply the corresponding point of the following ones):
	•	Use cases / user stories
	•	Functional specs
	•	State transitions
	•	Business rules

The non-functional requirements should output in new file /Users/digogonz/Desktop/Desarrollo/calendar-app/Enhancements/[x]/Non-FunctionalRequirements.md the following in concrete and write that concrete content (each concrete content below the abstract title which is simply the corresponding point of the following ones):
	•	Performance SLAs
	•	Availability targets
	•	Security requirements
	•	Scalability limits
	•	Compliance rules

The logical design should output in new file /Users/digogonz/Desktop/Desarrollo/calendar-app/Enhancements/[x]/LogicalDesign.md the following in concrete and write that concrete content (each concrete content below the abstract title which is simply the corresponding point of the following ones):
	•	System structure (components, modules, domains)
	•	Responsibilities and interfaces
	•	Data & behavior models
	•	Control & interaction flows
	•	Invariants & constraints


The technical design should output in new file /Users/digogonz/Desktop/Desarrollo/calendar-app/Enhancements/[x]/TechnicalDesign.md  the following in concrete and write that concrete content (each concrete content below the abstract title which is simply the corresponding point of the following ones):
	•	Concrete technologies
	•	Deployment topology
	•	Data storage choices
	•	Protocols and formats
	•	Resource sizing
	•	Failure & recovery mechanisms

The implementation should output in new file /Users/digogonz/Desktop/Desarrollo/calendar-app/Enhancements/[x]/Implementation.md  the following in concrete and write that concrete content (each concrete content below the abstract title which is simply the corresponding point of the following ones):
	•	Plan
	•	Running code artifacts (binaries, services, packages)
	•	Source code aligned with design
	•	Automated tests
	•	Buildable & deployable units
