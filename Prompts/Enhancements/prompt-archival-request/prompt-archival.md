prompt: Very good. Please make a list of the prompts I have gave you in this conversartion. Determine if each one corresponds to an enhacenment or a bug, then determine the enhacement/bug, all of the prompts related to same enhancement/bug would end in a same folder (ill clarify next), and group prompts related to a same issue into a same file,in such file the prompts would be seppared by a blank line and then a line with --- and the another blank line, sorted by order of appeareance (first prompt wrote appears first).Now let me clarify srchitecutre; For each bug/enhacmenet create a folder with a good descriptive practical name, which you will put either in /Users/digogonz/Desktop/Desarrollo/calendar-app/Prompts/Enhancements or in /Users/digogonz/Desktop/Desarrollo/calendar-app/Prompts/Bugs accordingly, and inside that folder a descriptive name for enhancement/bug, inside that folder put the files with a descriptive name of the issue the group of prompts addreses.

answer: Created issue folders with grouped prompt files.

suggestion: Tell me if you want different grouping or folder names.
