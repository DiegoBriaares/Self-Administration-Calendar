prompt: Please make a list of the prompts I have gave you in this conversartion. Determine if each one corresponds
  to an enhacenment or a bug, then determine the enhacement/bug, all of the prompts related to same enhancement/bug
  would end in a same folder (ill clarify next), and group prompts related to a same issue into a same file,in such
  file the prompts would be seppared by a blank line and then a line with --- and the another blank line, sorted by
  order of appeareance (first prompt wrote appears first).Now let me clarify srchitecutre; For each bug/enhacmenet
  create a folder with a good descriptive practical name, which you will put either in /Users/digogonz/Desktop/
  Desarrollo/plan-administration-management-system/Prompts/Enhancements or in /Users/digogonz/Desktop/Desarrollo/plan-administration-management-system/Prompts/Bugs
  accordingly, and inside that folder a descriptive name for enhancement/bug, inside that folder put the files with a
  descriptive name of the issue the group of prompts addreses.

 Also lets not only retrieve the prompts, also the final question/sugestion you give with a brief
  essential description of the changes, for example in this last prompt the suggestion was If you want a different
  grouping or folder naming scheme, tell me the adjustments, and a bried description is: created the folders and files.
  (note that i dont want the complete report just a small description that serves as context for future prompts that
  were performed). The format to store them and linked them to the prompts is: in the file where the prompts are
  stored, for each prompt this is the format: prompt: <prompt>, and in the next line: answer: <brief description> +
  <suggestion>. 

leave a blank line between prompt:<>, answer: <>, sugestion:<> in the files with the prompts.

Also from the bug/enhancements folder, infeer/deduce a natural language explanation of the enhacenment/bug, and add to plan-administration-management-system/Bugs or plan-administration-management-system/Enhancements (acordingly) a file named xxx - y, where xxx is the next prefix number of bug/enhacenment (accordingly to the greatest numnber in the directory (including inside /Solved) and y is the folder name, the content of the file is the explanation.
