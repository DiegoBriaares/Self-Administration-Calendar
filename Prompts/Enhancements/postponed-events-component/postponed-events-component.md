prompt: New component - accesible in front end through a button between the coordinates (months) selector component and the calendar component. Button displaying text Postponed events". When button is clicked, it brings you to a new page, which has the same three features of the Day Administration component, with exact same functionality as the current functionality (current functionality will change by incorporating this new component, but I'll describe afterwards), but with different names: (DAY EVENTS ADMINISTRATION -> EVENTS ADMINISTRATION, DAY EVENTS INFORMATION -> EVENTS INFORMATION, DAY EVENTS MANAGEMENT -> EVENTS MANAGEMENT) - This new component is called Postponed events component and it should have its own database table(s), independent to the tables for the events on days in the calendar. Inside the page with the Administration component (this name also changes: Day Administration -> Administration), all functionalities should be copied, including adding events directly (without moving/copying from a particular day).

answer: Added postponed events backend/storage, UI page, navigation button, and updated labels/flows to mirror the day administration features.

suggestion: Run the API and dev server to verify the new page and transfer actions.
