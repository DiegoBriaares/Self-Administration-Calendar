lets add a functionaly for stablishing priroirty to the events. So that when creating/editing an event there is a
  field to ingress an integer (priority). The priority should also be displayed together with the time of the day. The
  order of the displayment on the calendar (withhout selected just the superficial display) is still by hour. However
  when selecting a day (thus opening the pop-up window) in the pop-up window there should be configuration setting
  mechansim for determinig the order criteria (by hour or priority). A configuration setting mechanism should also
  exist in both of the displayings below the calendar (the one for edit/delete) and the one for ranges. Please do
