prompt: Add a feature for the Roles components. In the Roles section of the user drop-down menu, each role, besides the trash icon, it has another icon to "Add a Subrole"... (requirements/design/implement).

answer: Implemented subrole CRUD, role/subrole selection flow, and wrote requirements/design docs.

suggestion: Run the API/client to verify the flow and optionally add admin DB visibility for subroles.

prompt: Hi sorry for interrumpting, I changed a bit the prompt to specify where to output the requirements/design markdowns, and also added instruction to output implementation markdown... (updated file paths).

answer: Moved documentation outputs to the specified directory and completed wiring for subroles.

suggestion: Verify the UI flow in dev and confirm server creates the new table.

prompt: Excellent! Run this prompt: /Users/digogonz/Desktop/Desarrollo/plan-administration-management-system/Prompts/Actions/CompiledPrompts/FetchAndStorePromptsAndGlobalPushAndDeploy/Prompt.agcomp

answer: Archived prompts, added changelog and enhancement/bug notes, opened PR #15, ran deploy (server npm install failed with ENOTEMPTY), and archived the prod snapshot.

suggestion: Retry the server npm install or clear the `server/node_modules/cacache` rename issue, then confirm services restarted.
