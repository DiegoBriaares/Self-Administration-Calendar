prompt: Add a feature for the postponed events component. At the postponed events page, at the top-right of the Event Administration subcomponent, add a view selector... and update day administration copy/move to select view.

answer: Added postponed view metadata, view toggle, filtered all postponed subcomponents, and added a target view selector for copy/move to postponed.

suggestion: Verify view switching and postponed transfers in dev.

---

prompt: Good. Now it makes sense that the Event management feature in the postponed events component also allows to move/copy events to postponed events... Please add this enhancement

answer: Added move/copy between postponed views from the postponed management panel.

suggestion: Confirm transfers between "This week" and "All" views behave as expected.

---

prompt: Fix similarly for calendar component; Please isolate days i.e All computations and memory of one day components and features should be independent and unaffected by other day sub components and features

answer: Routed day administration state to be per-day so switching dates does not leak state.

suggestion: Switch between multiple days to verify drafts and selections persist per day.

---

prompt: Add this enhancement. Remember states (in client side) of whats happen in the three features of the days and as well for the postponed events...

answer: Persisted client-side state per day and per postponed view, retaining selections and inputs across switches.

suggestion: Optionally add localStorage persistence if state should survive refreshes.
