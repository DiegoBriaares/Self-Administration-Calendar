prompt: Change DAY EVENTS MANAGEMENT to DAY EVENTS ADMINISTRATION (and make the text a bit not so bit larger) and change COPY EVENTS to DAY EVENTS MANAGEMENT and in this component add an option to either copy or move the events instead of only copying option as it currently is

answer: Updated day-event labels to Day Events Administration, renamed Copy Events to Day Events Management, and added a copy/move action toggle for selected range events.

suggestion: Offer to add the move option to the range-selection modal if you want consistent controls there.
