prompt: Very good. There is a bug (previous to this work of yours) at which the most bottom role cant be deleted... Please fix

answer: Fixed the bottom-role delete hitbox by making decorative overlays ignore pointer events.

suggestion: Optionally add an empty-state call to action in the roles modal.
