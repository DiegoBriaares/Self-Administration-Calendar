prompt: There is a bug; Selected count in the event management in the postponed event component counts selected events independently of view... Please isolate view.

answer: Isolated postponed management state by view so selected counts and inputs no longer leak across views.

suggestion: Toggle between views after selecting items to verify independent counts.
